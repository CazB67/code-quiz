# Code Quiz
Assignment 4

## Description
The task of this assignment was to build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. The deployed application shows understanding of Javascript particularly on click events, event listeners and timing functions and runs in the browser. It features a clean user interface and is responsive.
The assignment criteria are:
* A button that when clicked starts a timer and presents a question. 
* When that question is answered another question is asked.
* An incorrect answer causes time to be subtracted from the clock.
* The game ends when timer reaches 0 or all questions are answered.
* When the game is over initials and score are saved.
